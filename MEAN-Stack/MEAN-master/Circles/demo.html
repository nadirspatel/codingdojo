	Demonstrating how you can detect how long your mouse was clicked or held down.  Open your console to see how it works.

	<script>
	//using immediate function to avoid global variable issues
	function time_pressed(){

		var mousedown_time;

		function getTime(){
			var date = new Date();
			return date.getTime();
		}

		document.onmousedown = function(e){
			mousedown_time = getTime();
		}
		document.onmouseup = function(e){
			pressed = getTime() - mousedown_time;
			console.log('You held your mouse down for', pressed, 'miliseconds.');
		}

		//technically we don't even need the mousedown variable but we're leaving it there for now..
		return pressed;

	};
