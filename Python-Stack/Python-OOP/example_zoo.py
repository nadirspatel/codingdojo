#Zoo Example
#Imagine a game where you can create a zoo and start raising different types of animals.  Say that for each zoo you create, it can have different list of animals.  One way you could put together this zoo is by doing the following:

class Zoo:
    def __init__(self, zoo_name):
        self.animals = []
        self.name = zoo_name
    def addDog(self, name):
        self.animals.append( Dog(name) )
    def addDragon(self, name):
        self.animals.append( Dragon(name) )
    def printAllHealth(self):
        print("-"*30, self.name, "-"*30)
        for animal in self.animals:
            animal.displayHealth()
zoo1 = Zoo("John's Zoo")
zoo1.addDog("Tracy")
zoo1.addDog("Doggy")
zoo1.addDragon("Draggy")
zoo1.addDragon("Dragoon")
zoo1.printAllHealth()
